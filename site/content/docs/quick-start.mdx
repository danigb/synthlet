Synthlet is a collection of audio modules implemented as [AudioWorkletNodes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioWorklet) that you can use to create synthesizers and audio effects in the browser.

<Callout title="Synthlet is still wip" type="warn">
  Currently Synthlet is under development and not ready for production use. Use
  at your own risk.
</Callout>

## Install

You can installl all modules using the `synthlet` package:

```package-install
synthlet
```

## Register worklet processors

Before you can create any module, you need to register the worklet processors. You can do this by calling the `registerSynthlet` to register all modules at once:

```js
import { registerSynthlet } from "synthlet";

const audioContext = new audioContext();
await registerSynthlet(audioContext);
```

<Callout title="Register is async" type="warn">
  `registerSynthlet` (and all register functions) are async, so ensure you await
  for the result before creating any modules.
</Callout>

## Example

A simple archetipical monophonic synthesizer consist of an oscillator connected to a filter connected to an amplifier with an envelope:

```js
const osc = createPolyblepOscillatorNode(audioContext, {
  frequency: 440,
});
const filter = createStateVariableFilterNode(audioContext, {
  type: SvfType.Lowpass,
  frequency: 5000,
  resonance: 2,
});
const vca = createVcaNode(audioContext, {
  attack: 0.01,
  decay: 0.1,
  sustain: 0.7,
  release: 0.3,
});

osc.connect(filter).connect(vca).connect(audioContext.destination);

// Trigger the envelope
vca.gate.value = 1;
```

At this point you should able to hear some sound. If you don't hear anything, check the browser console for any errors.

<Callout title="No start required" type="warn">
  Unlike the standard WebAudio API, Synthlet modules start automatically. No
  need to call the `start` method on the module to start it.
</Callout>

Read more about how to use the modules in the [guide](/docs/guide).

## Operators

The `synthlet` package wraps the modules in a set of operators to create complex synths by combining simple modules in a functional way. This is the exact same example as above in a Synthlet way:

```js
import { synthlet } from "synthlet";

// Register all modules and create the operators
const s = await synthlet(new AudioContext());

// Use the operators to create audio graph
const gate = s.param(audioContext);
const out = s.connect(
  s.saw(440),
  s.svflp(5000, 2),
  s.vca(gate, 0.01, 0.1, 0.7, 0.3)
);

gate.value = 1;
```
