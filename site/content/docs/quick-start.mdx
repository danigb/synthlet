description: How to get started with Synthlet
---

Synthlet is a collection of audio modules implemented as [AudioWorkletNodes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioWorklet).

The main goal of this project is to learn digital signal processing for my own, so don't expect a full-featured audio library. However, I'm trying to make it as useful as possible for my own projects.

<Callout title="Synthlet is still experimental" type="warn">
  Currently Synthlet is under development and not ready for production use. Use
  at your own risk.
</Callout>

## Install

You can installl all modules using the `synthlet` package:

```package-install
synthlet
```

## Register worklet processors

Before you can create any module, you need to register the worklet processors. You can do this by calling the `registerSynthlet` to register all modules at once:

```js
import { registerSynthlet } from "synthlet";

const audioContext = new audioContext();
await registerSynthlet(audioContext);
```

<Callout title="Register is async" type="warn">
  `registerSynthlet` (and all register functions) are async, so ensure you await
  for the result before creating any modules.
</Callout>

## Example

A simple archetipical monophonic synthesizer consist of an oscillator connected to a filter connected to an amplifier with an envelope. This is how to do it with Synthlet:

```js
const osc = createPolyblepOscillatorNode(audioContext, {
  frequency: 440,
});
const filter = createStateVariableFilterNode(audioContext, {
  type: "lowpass",
  frequency: 5000,
  resonance: 2,
});
const vca = createVcaNode(audioContext, {});

osc.connect(filter).connect(vca).connect(audioContext.destination);

// Trigger the envelope
vca.gate.value = 1;
```

At this point you should able to hear some sound. If you don't hear anything, check the browser console for any errors.

<Callout title="No start required" type="warn">
  Unlike the standard WebAudio API, Synthlet modules start automatically. No
  need to call the `start` method on the module to start it.
</Callout>

Read more about how to use the modules in the [guide](/docs/guide).

## Installing individual modules

If you want to optimize for bundle size, you can use the individual module packages and register each module individually.

Install:

```package-install
@synthlet/polyblep-oscillator
```

And register:

```js
import { registerPolyblepOscillator } from "@synthlet/polyblep-oscillator";
import { registerPolyblepOscillator } from "synthlet";

const audioContext = new audioContext();
await registerPolyblepOscillator(audioContext);
```
