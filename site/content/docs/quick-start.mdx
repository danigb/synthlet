Synthlet is a collection of audio modules implemented as [AudioWorkletNodes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioWorklet) that you can use to create synthesizers and audio effects in the browser.

## Install

You can installl all modules using the `synthlet` package:

```package-install
synthlet
```

## Register worklet processors

Before you can create any module, you need to register the worklet processors. You can do this by calling the `registerAllWorklets` to register all modules at once:

```js
import { registerAllWorklets } from "synthlet";

const audioContext = new AudioContext();
await registerAllWorklets(audioContext);
```

<Callout title="Register is async" type="warn">
  `registerAllWorklets` (and all register functions) are async, so ensure you
  await for the result before creating any modules.
</Callout>

By convenience, `registerAllWorklets` returns the `AudioContext` so you can write it more concise:

```js
const audioContext = await registerAllWorklets(new AudioContext());
```

## Create the first synth

You can create a synth by creating nodes and connect them.

A simple archetipical monophonic synthesizer consist of an oscillator connected to a filter connected to an amplifier with an envelope.

Here's the full gist:

```js
import {
  registerAllWorklets
  PolyblepOscillator,
  VirtualAnalogFilter,
  AdsrAmp,
} from "synthlet";

const ac = await registerAllWorklets(new AudioContext());

const osc = PolyblepOscillator(ac, {frequency: 440 });
const filter = VirtualAnalogFilter(ac, {
  type: VirtualAnalogFilter.MOOG_LADDER,
  frequency: 1500,
});
const vca = AdsrAmp(ac, {
  attack: 0.01,
  decay: 0.1,
  sustain: 0.7,
  release: 0.3,
});

osc.connect(filter).connect(vca).connect(ac.destination);

// Trigger the envelope
vca.gate.value = 1;
```

At this point you should able to hear some sound. If you don't hear anything, check the browser console for any errors.

<Callout title="No new required" type="warn">
  Unlike the standard WebAudio API, Synthlet modules are functions, not classes.
  So no `new` is required to create a module.
</Callout>

<Callout title="No start required" type="warn">
  Unlike the standard WebAudio API, Synthlet modules start automatically. No
  need to call the `start` method on the module to start it.
</Callout>

Read more about how to use the modules in the [guide](/docs/guide).
