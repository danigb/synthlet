Some synthesizers are provided for convenience. They are implemented by connecting different modules together.

## Mono synthesizer

A monophonic synthesizer with a single PolyBLEP oscillator and an ADSR envelope on the filter and amplifier.

<MonoExample />

## Drums

Several drum synthesizers are available, all with the same constructor: `Drum(audioContext, inputs)`:

```ts
import { KickDrum } from "synthlet";

const kick = KickDrum(audioContext, { tone: 0.2, decay: 0.7 });
kick.trigger.value = 1;
kick.tone.value = 0.5;
```

<DrumExample />

### Parameters

All drum modules share the same parameters:

- `trigger`: 0 or 1, triggers the drum sound
- `tone`: 0 to 1, changes the timbre of the drum (scale depends on the drum)
- `decay`: 0 to 1, changes the length of the drum sound (sale depends on the drum)
- `volume`: in decibels. Default is 0.
