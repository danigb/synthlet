import NoiseExample from "../../examples/NoiseExample";

Some synthesizers are provided for convenience. They are implemented by connecting different modules together.

## Mono synthesizer

A monophonic synthesizer with a single PolyBLEP oscillator and an ADSR envelope on the filter and amplifier.

```ts
import { registerAllWorklets, MonoSynth } from "synthlet";

const ac = registerAllWorklets(new AudioContext());
const synth = MonoSynth(ac);

synth.gate.value = 1;

// It exposes several sub-modules
synth.vibrato.frequency.value = 0.5;
synth.filterEnv.attack.value = 0.1;
```

<MonoExample />

### Parameters

- `gate`: 0 or 1, triggers the envelope
- `frequency`: in Hz
- `volume`: in decibels. Default is 0.

### Modules

- `vibrato`: LFO for pitch modulation
- `filterEnv`: ADSR envelope the filter

## Drums

Several drum synthesizers are available, all with the same constructor: `Drum(audioContext, inputs)`:

```ts
import { registerAllWorklets, KickDrum } from "synthlet";

const ac = registerAllWorklets(new AudioContext());
const kick = KickDrum(ac, { tone: 0.2, decay: 0.7 });
kick.trigger.value = 1;
kick.tone.value = 0.5;
```

<DrumExample />

### Parameters

All drum modules share the same parameters:

- `trigger`: 0 or 1, triggers the drum sound
- `tone`: 0 to 1, changes the timbre of the drum (scale depends on the drum)
- `decay`: 0 to 1, changes the length of the drum sound (sale depends on the drum)
- `volume`: in decibels. Default is 0.

### Available drums

The following drums are available:

- `KickDrum`
- `SnareDrum`
- `ClaveDrum`
- `HiHatDrum`
- `CowBellDrum`
- `CymbalDrum`
- `MaracasDrum`
- `HandclapDrum`
- `TomDrum`
- `CongaDrum`
