This guide will show you how to use the Synthlet modules.

## Create modules

To create a module, you need to call the `create<Module>Node` function that will return an instance of an [AudioWorkletNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioWorkletNode)

The create function will take two arguments, the `audioContext` and an object with optional configuration and initial values of each parameter:

```js
const osc = createPolyblepOscillatorNode(audioContext, {
  frequency: 440,
});

const lfo = createLfoNode(audioContext, {
  attack: 0.1,
  decay: 0.1,
  sustain: 0.5,
  release: 0.1,
});
```

## Connect modules to the audio graph

Since returning nodes are normal [AudioWorkletNodes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioWorkletNode/AudioWorkletNode) , you can [connect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioNode/connect) them to the audio graph as you would with any other node:

```js
// Connect a module to another
osc.connect(audioContext.destination);

// Connect a module to a parameter (modulation)
adsr.connect(osc.frequency);
```

## Controlling Parameters

Each module has a set of parameters exposed as [AudioParam](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioParam) that you can control using the `value` property the same way as you would with any other Web Audio API node:

```js
osc.frequency.value = 880;
adsr.attack.value = 0.5;
```

## Start and stop

There are no `start` and `stop` methods in Synthlet modules, sources are started by default.

<Callout title="No start/stop" type="warn">
  Unlike the standard WebAudio API, Synthlet modules starts automatically.
</Callout>

The modules that needs some kind of start/stop (envelopes, sequencers, etc...) the control is managed with parameters too. For example, `start` and `stop` methods are normally replaced by a `gate` parameter that you can control using the `setValueAtTime` method:

```js
adsr.gate.value = 1; // equivalent to start()
adsr.gate.value = 0; // equivalent to stop()
```

The advantage is that you can use a module to start/stop other modules. Evertying can be connected.

## Disconnect

To disconnect a module from the audio graph, you can use the `disconnect` method in the same way as you would with any other Web Audio API node:

```js
adsr.disconnect();
```

Once disconnected, the module will stop processing audio and can't be connected again.
