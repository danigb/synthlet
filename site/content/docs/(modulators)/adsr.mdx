title: ADSR Envelope
description: An ADSR envelope generator module
---

This is an ADSR envelope generator module that can be used to modulate any other parameter.

Is based on the code by [Will Pirkle](https://www.willpirkle.com/) from his [Synth Book](https://www.willpirkle.com/synthbook/).

# Example

```ts
import { createADSRNode } from "synthlet";

const adsr = createADSRNode(audioContext, {
  attack: 0.1,
  decay: 0.1,
  sustain: 0.5,
  release: 0.1,
});
const filter = StateVariableFilter(audioContext, {
  frequency: 440,
  Q: 1,
  type: "lowpass",
});
adsr.connect(filter.frequency);
```

#### Parameters

- `attack`: The attack time in seconds. Default is 0.1.
- `decay`: The decay time in seconds. Default is 0.1.
- `sustain`: The sustain level. Default is 0.5.
- `release`: The release time in seconds. Default is 0.1.
- `offset`: The start offset. Default is 0.
- `gain`: The gain. Default is 1. It is the maximum amplitude after the attach and affects the sustain level. For example, a gain of 100 and sustain of 0.5 will make the sustain level to be 50.
