title: AD Envelope
description: An Attack-Release exponential envelope generator
---

import { AttackDecayExample } from "../../../examples/AttackDecayExample";

This is a one-stage envelope generator useful to create percusive sounds.

Unlike ADSR, this envelope can finish before the gate is released.

```ts
import { createAdNode, registerAdWorklet } from "synthlet";

const audioContext = new AudioContext();
await registerAdWorklet(audioContext);

const ad = createAdNode(audioContext, {
  attack: 0.1,
  decay: 0.1,
  gain: 1,
});
const osc = new OscillatorNode(audioContext);
osc.start();
const amp = new GainNode(audioContext, { gain: 0 });
ad.connect(amp.gain);

ad.trigger.value = 1;
```

## Parameters

- `attack`: The attack time in seconds. Default is 0.1.
- `decay`: The decay time in seconds. Default is 0.1.
- `trigger`: The envelope trigger. 1 means start. You need to move the trigger back to 1 to restart the envelope.
- `offset`: The offset of the envelope. Default is 0.
- `gain`: The gain of the envelope. Default is 1.
