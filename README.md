# Synthlet

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/synthlet)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/synthlet)

Collection of synth modules implemented as AudioWorklets written in Typescript. Currently, dsp is mostly a port of Will Pirkle's Designing Synth Plugins 2nd Edition book. Thanks Will üôå

```ts
import { loadSynthlet } from "synthlet";

const { osc, filter, chain, adsr, now, trigger, param } = loadSynthlet(context);

// A WebAudio normal oscillator

const gate = trigger();
const frequency = param(440);

const disconnect = chain(
  mix(
    osc({ type: AvOscillator.SAW, frequency, detune: 2 }),
    osc({ type: AvOscillator.SAW, frequency, detune: -2 })
  ),
  filter({ frequency: 3000 }),
  adsr({ gate }),
  context.destination
);

gate.noteOn(now());
frequency.setValueAtTime(880, now() + 0.5);
gate.noteOff(now() + 1);

disconnect();
```

‚ö†Ô∏è This is extremely alpha software. Use at your own risk (and be careful with volume and filter resonance)

## FAQ (not F, not even A)

#### Why?

Basically, to learn and for others to learn from. Most open source synths are written in C or some other low level language. This library is written in Typescript to make it more accessible (at the cost of performance).

#### How is different from WebAudio API (WAA) built-in nodes?

It have more nodes, basically. Most of them are different. Some of dsp could be done by creating WAA nodes. See why?

#### How is different from Tone.js

First of all, this is alpha. If you need to do something serious, use Tone.js

Then, Tone.js and Synthlet have different scope, focus and philosophy. The scope of Synthlet is creating synths. No more. The focus is on dsp code. And the philosophy is not wrap WAA but provide more nodes.

On the other hand, Tone.js provides most of the things you need to create music with WAA.

## Setup

#### Package

Install using npm or any other package manager:

```bash
npm i synthlet
```

#### Browser

## Usage

#### Load worklets

The first step is to load the worklets into an AudioContext. The simplest way is to load them all:

```js
import { loadSynthlet } from "synthlet";

const Synthlet = await loadSynthlet(new AudioContext());

const osc = Synthlet.osc({ frequency: 440 }).connect(destination);

// after some time...
osc.disconnect();
```

But you can choose which ones to load if you don't need or want the full library:

```js
import { loadKarplusStrongOscillator } from "synthlet";

const ks = await loadKarplusStrongOscillator(context);

const osc = ks({ note: 60 }).connect(context.destination);
osc.disconnect();
```

#### Create nodes

The load function returns a promise to a function that create audio nodes:

```js
import { loadLfo } from "synthlet";

const createLfo = await loadLfo(context);
const lfo = createLfo({ frequency: 10 }); // lfo is an AudioNode
```

#### Connect nodes

Each node is a normal WebAudio API `AudioNode` so the same principles apply:

```js
const osc = new OscillatorNode(context, { frequency: 440 });
lfo.connect(osc.frequency);
osc.start();
```

## Modules

#### ADSR

An attack-decay-sustain-release envelope.

#### Lfo

A low frequency oscillator with several waveforms and extras.

#### Virtual Analog Oscillator

Oscillator based on Blip algorithm

#### Wavetable Oscillator
