# Synthlet

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/synthlet)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/synthlet)

Collection of synth modules implemented as AudioWorklets.

```ts
import {
  registerAllWorklets,
  AdsrAmp,
  Svf,
  SvfType,
  PolyblepOscillator
} from "synthlet";

const ac = new AudioContext();
await registerAllWorklets(ac);

// Simplest synth: Oscillator -> Filter -> Amplifier
const osc = PolyblepOscillator(ac, { frequency: 440 });
const filter = Svf(ac, {
  type: SvfType.LowPass
  frequency: 4000,
});
const amp = AdsrAmp(ac, { attack: 0.1, release: 0.5 });
osc.connect(filter).connect(amp).connect(ac.destination);

// Change parameters
osc.frequency.value = 1200;

// Start sound
amp.gate.value = 1;

// Stop sound
vca.gate.value = 0;
```

## Install

Install `synthlet` to install all modules:

```bash
npm i synthlet
```

Or each module individually:

```bash
npm i @synthlet/adsr
```

## Documentation

Documentation and examples are [here](https://danigb.github.io/synthlet/docs/quick-start)

### Why?

Mostly, because I want to learn dsp. But I'd like to create a collection of high quality sounding sources and effects.

### Is it a good idea to write dsp in Typescript?

Probably not, but I've seen [a talk at WAC 2022](https://zenodo.org/records/6767468) about it that made me think it is possible (thanks to JS engine optimizations).

### Should I use it?

Maybe, for fun and profit. If you want to make music, [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js) is probably the way to go.

If you want to deploy dsp modules to web in production, currently [Faust](https://faustdoc.grame.fr/) and [Cmajor](https://github.com/cmajor-lang/cmajor) or [Elementary Audio](https://github.com/elemaudio/elementary) are better alternatives.
